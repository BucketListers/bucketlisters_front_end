# Bucketlist Builder

This is a full stack application called Bucketlist Builder. It is designed in a way so that you can pick a city and a location and add it to your bucket list.

The Bucketlist Builder allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete locations and activities.

# General Approach

Starting with the backend Dan was in charge of setting it up the routes, controllers, models, and setting up the database. Pablo was in charge of setting up Ajax and click handlers with the help from Dan. Christine was in charge of the frontend in setting up the html and css making the website look attractive and inspiring for users to create a bucket list.
